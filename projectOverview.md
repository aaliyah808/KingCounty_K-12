# KC K-12 Overview
## About
This project was created by Aaliyah Davis for LIS546 Data Curation II at the University of Washington. It’s concerned with open access data collected by federal, state, and local entities. Some data are published by non-profit organizations and foundations, but sourced from government entities. Federal, state, and local entities are required to report on a variety of topics relating to children aged 0-17. Most of these requirements are mandated by laws and regulations and beholden to funding. This repository is a collection of data that focus on children and youth in King County, Washington. Objects are sourced from the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), Washington state’s Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF),  the Washington State Health Care Authority - Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery (DBHR), the Washington Department of Health (DOH), the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (LCB), and the Washington State Office of Financial Management (OFM). Amalgamated datasets are from the Healthy Youth Survey, the Center for Social Sector Analytics & Technology (CSSAT), and the Annie E Casey Foundation’s KidsCount initiative. Topics include mental health, houselessness, foster care and out of home placement, school enrollment and education measures; and socioeconomic, racial, gender, and sexuality demographics. 

## Project motivations, background, and intended uses
  The current flurry of legislation limiting [reproductive autonomy](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/upshot/abortion-bans-states-social-services.html), [the legal rights of trans people](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/may-anti-trans-legislative-risk-map), and [culturally informed education](https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/culture-wars-impact-public-schools) is quickly making life for the already marginalized even more desolate. If these changes are happening at the federal level, then those systems should also be utilized (in tandem with other methods) to combat these laws. Further, these actions by lawmakers at all levels of government are severely impacting those with no voice in civic life because they are under the age of 18. Student data is largely self-reported and students can opt out if they would like, so this is essentially the only way for their voices to be included in the policy decisions and programs that these data are meant to inform. 
  Data are curated for use by teachers, parents, school boards and superintendents, social workers, legislators; education, housing, and civil rights policymakers (lobbyists, activists, researchers); and child advocacy agencies nonprofits. Moreover, this repository is for any group or individual involved in advancing equity in areas of: child welfare, housing & homelessness, trans rights, reproductive justice, public education, and their intersections. School boards, superintendents, and other policy/decision makers should be aware of the needs and traumas that children within their district and schools are experiencing in order to better serve them as well as address underlying issues related to achievement and low enrollment. In Washington state, and particularly King County, [homelessness](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/what-do-you-want-to-know-about-k-12-student-homelessness/) and [school enrollment](https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/to-save-money-seattle-may-need-to-close-some-schools) are major issues. The national issues mentioned above are not as insidious in King County as they have been throughout the country, but monitoring these trends are still important. It’s the goal of this repository to expand to all of Washington state and further.
