# Collection Policy 

This repository is submission-based and requires approval from the depositoryâ€™s manager. Data within this repository are all from government collection and focus on K-12 education, child health and wellness, foster care, child populations, and marginalized children. Data from non-governmental agencies are contained in this collection, but they are transformations of government data. All data are published in the public domain and are licensed under CC. Parties interested in submitting should review Transformations and Data Quality.
